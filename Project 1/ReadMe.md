Project 1:

In this project, I will create an artist website for Jose Gonzalez. 

On top of the website, I will make like a jumbotron with the artist name and picture. Below that, I will add a hyperlink bar with Home, Discography, Tour, Videos and Shop. That bar will be common in all the website, suppose, if we click on discography, it will take the user to the discography page with albums arts and track list, however even though we are in a different page, the top hyperlink bar will always show Home, discography, tour, Videos and Shop. 
The tour dates will have a table with City, Date and an option to buy the ticket, when we buy any number of tickets and will have to put in our credit card information. 
The Shop page, will tshirts and albums we can buy which will require credit card information again
the Videos page, will have some youtubes videos (I might not include this if this is too complex)
the home page, I will have pictures and some of my fav. lines from his songs, it will also have a guest book box where we can put in our name and the message we want to send to the artist. For this project, when we submit the  message, we will just get a message saying, "message submitted" (like an alert)
