Project 1:

In this project, I am creating an artist website for Jose Gonzalez. 

I created a header page which is same for all webpages.
I used carousel feature from bootstrap to display the picture of the artist on home page. 
I created bootstrap grid system for the lay out of the page. 
On the right of the front row, I used twitter widget to pull all the latest feed which was sent to the artist.
I created a form which will ask for Name, email and message to send a message to the artist.
if any of the fields is blank, it will display an error saying we need to fill out everything.
Once everythingis filled out, it will say, message has been sent. I used jquery for the validation.
I put another input box on the right of the second row, which will ask for email to subscribe news letter.
It will give us an error if we invalid type of email address. I used html for the validation. 
Below that, I used a widge to play youtube playlist for the artist which will load automatically after the page loads.

For the discography page, I used accordion feature to make the albums collapse.
For the tour page, I created a bootstrap table and at first hid the bottom of the page.
Once we click on buy now, the page will then scroll down asking to choose the number of ticket. 
I used flat rate for all the locations, and it will display the total amount due when we hit buy. 

For the biography page, I just used few pictures and I wrapped the pictures with text.
